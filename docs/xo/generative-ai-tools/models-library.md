While Amazon Bedrock is available as an OOB integration, XO Platform does not provide any system prompts or templates. Users can only use the model with the help of custom prompts.

!!! note

    Before starting the integration process, ensure you have the necessary permissions and access to the IAM role and Amazon Bedrock resources in your AWS account. For more information, see [Policies and Permissions in AWS Identity and Access Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html).


### Configure Amazon Bedrock LLM Integration

Steps to integrate an Amazon Bedrock:


1. Go to **Generative AI Tools** > **Models Library**.
    <img src="../images/abr1.png" alt="Amazon Bedrock" title="Amazon Bedrock" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">
2. Click **Amazon Bedrock**.
3. On the **Authorization** tab, provide the following details.
    * **Provider Name**: Enter a name to identify the provider or group of language models you want to connect.
    * **Model Name**: Give a unique name to the language model you’re connecting with.
    * **Identity Access Management (IAM) Role ARN**: The IAM Role ARN enables the platform to securely access resources on behalf of users without the need for long-term access keys, supporting cross-account access, least privilege principles, and enhanced auditing capabilities.
    * **Amazon STS API**:
        * To assume an IAM role and obtain temporary security credentials, provide the AWS STS (Security Token Service) API endpoint, specifically the AssumeRole action. The STS API is essential for generating the temporary access key, secret key, and session token required to securely access AWS resources based on the permissions associated with the IAM role.
        * Ensure you have the correct endpoint URL for the AssumeRole action in the AWS region where your IAM role is located.
    * **Amazon Resource Name (ARN)**: The Amazon Bedrock ARN that grants your IAM role access to the specific Language Model in Amazon Bedrock. The ARN uniquely identifies the Language Model resource within the Amazon Bedrock service.
    * **Endpoint**: Enter the URL to interact with the Language Model’s API. 
    * **Headers**: If needed, include additional headers with metadata specific to your Language Model integration. These headers provide extra information or configuration options to the Language Model API.

## LLM Integration using Dynamic Variables

The Platform now enables seamless configuration of both pre-built and custom LLMs by allowing you to use content, context, and environment variables, including the secured ones. Secure Variables, particularly for environment settings, function just as smoothly as the current system ensures.

Before configuring the LLM, ensure all necessary variables are set up. For more details, see [Bot Variables](../app-settings/variables/using-bot-variables.md).

!!! note

    Co-Pilot features can use content and environment variables. Dynamic Conversations features can use content, context, and environment variables.


### Key Advantages

**Avoid Misuse of API Keys**: By utilizing secure environment variables for API keys, the system minimizes the risk of unauthorized access. Properly configured permissions restrict visibility and usage to authorized applications or personnel only.

**Track Team-Wise Consumption**: Implementing tracking mechanisms for API key usage allows teams to monitor their consumption, enabling better resource allocation and identifying potential inefficiencies.

**Rotate Your API Keys**: Regularly rotating API keys enhances security by limiting the risk associated with compromised keys. A well-defined rotation schedule ensures that even if a key is leaked, it becomes useless after a predetermined period.


### Configure Pre-built LLM Integration using Dynamic Variables

!!! note

    * For Azure OpenAI, you can set the API Key, Sub-Domain, and Model Deployment IDs as dynamic variables.
