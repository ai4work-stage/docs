# Agent Dashboard (My Dashboard) - Agent View

**My Dashboard** is the Agent Dashboard for agents’ view, which offers detailed insights into your activity and performance as an agent.

Each agent has a personalized dashboard, which is accessible to both the agents. In this, the agents can view their performance through scorecards provided by their supervisors. This setup allows agents to take appropriate actions based on their performance metrics.

Users can view **My Dashboard** by navigating to **Contact Center AI** > **Quality Management** > **Analyze** > **My Dashboard**.

In this, you can filter all your interaction channels (Voice and SMS or both) by selecting the following date ranges:

* **Today**: All interaction data for this day, in the agent’s time zone.
* **Yesterday**: All interaction data of the previous day, in the agent’s time zone.
* **Last 7 days**: All interaction data for the previous 7 days (not including today), in the agent’s time zone.
* **Last 28 days**: All interaction data for the previous 28 days, (not including today), in the agent’s time zone.
* **Last 90 days**: All interaction data for the previous 90 days, (not including today), in the agent’s time zone.
* **Custom Range**: All interaction data from the given date (12:00:00 AM to 11:59:59 PM), in the agent’s time zone, limited to **31** days.

!!! Note

    If the Supervisor or Admin has not enabled the **Auto QA** and **Agent Scorecard** toggle option in the Quality AI displayed under **Settings**, then you will not be able to view the automated scoring of interactions in the Dashboard.

* **Daily**: Last 7 days from the current date.
* **Weekly**: Last 7 weeks from the current week of the year.

#### Avg. Scorecard Score

From the agent side, the scorecard trend widget shows the average scorecard for the selected time range and the scoring trend time ranges at an attribute level in a tabular view.
