# Dashboard Overview

The Dashboard overview provides a 360-degree view of audit details, failure statistics, and performance monitoring of the agent Evaluation forms on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. It stores data for the past seven months. By default, the Dashboard displays the daily report for all three categories, offering a quick overview to monitor quality standards at any given point in time.

You can access **Dashboard** by navigating to **Contact Center AI** > **Quality Management** > **Analyze** > **Dashboard**.

### Evaluation Score 
This displays the trend of the average **Kore Evaluation Score** (Auto QA Score) alongside the average **Audit Score** (manual), allowing you to compare the consistency between system-generated evaluations and manual audits. 

You can view both automated interactions and manual audits scores across the following date ranges:

## Adherence Heatmap
This enables supervisors to view and track trends in agent compliance with specific metrics over time. It highlights interactions where agents consistently fail to meet metrics and offers the ability to filter non-compliant interactions. By analyzing the heatmap, supervisors can quickly identify areas of concern, monitor agent performance across evaluation forms or queues, and pinpoint agents who need attention. This provides actionable insights, helping supervisors make informed decisions and take targeted steps to drive improvement.

Overall, it provides failure statistics for evaluation forms and scorecards for a specified time period.

### Evaluation Form
This chart displays failure rates across the selected evaluation forms, making it easy to track any increases in failure rates. It allows you to quickly identify issues and take appropriate action, without the need to manually review individual failed interactions.
