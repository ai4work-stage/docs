# Supervisor Dashboard Overview

The Dashboard overview provides a 360-degree view of audit details, failure statistics, and performance monitoring of the agent Evaluation forms on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. It stores data for the past seven months. By default, the Dashboard displays the daily report for all three categories, offering a quick overview to monitor quality standards at any given point in time.
