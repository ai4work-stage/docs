# Agentic Apps

Agentic applications enable the sequential execution of multiple AI agents to accomplish and automate complex tasks efficiently using AI agents. These applications streamline workflows by automating interactions and decision-making processes based on predefined logic and user input.

## Creating Agentic App

Follow these steps to create a new Agentic App:

1. **Access the Admin Console**
    * Navigate to **AI Agents** in the left pane.
    * Select **Agentic Apps** to view the list of existing applications.

2. **Initiate Agent Creation**
    * Click **+Create Agent** on the Agentic App page.
    * The **Prompt Agentic App Creation Wizard** guides you through the setup process.

### Step 1: Details and Purpose

Define your app's name and purpose for optimal performance.

* **App Name**: Enter a unique and meaningful name for your app.
* **Purpose**: Defines the intended functionality of the app for query routing and training. This field specifies both the default prompt and sample queries that help the system in correctly routing user queries to the appropriate application.

**Note**: A well-defined purpose enhances the agent’s ability to correctly interpret and execute tasks, ensuring precise and effective responses to user queries.

### Step 2: Build Agentic Flow

Customize the app's workflow using a prompt-based interface.

1. **Prompt**: A default prompt is auto-generated based on the agent’s purpose. This prompt can be customized using variables. Based on the defined purpose, the system automatically generates the necessary workflow steps to complete the task. For example, in a financial advisor workflow, performing research, checking who owns the shares, and deciding to sell or hold shares based on research.

2. Click **Get Flow** to review.
3. Customize your flow as needed:
    * To add a step: Click **+ Add** button above or below any existing step.
    * To edit or delete a step: Hover on the step and find options to either edit or delete the step.
    <img src="../images/Agentic_App_5.png" alt="Edit" title="Edit" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">
    * To reorder steps: Drag and drop steps to the desired position.
4. Click **Run** to execute all configured steps sequentially.
5. Click **Continue** to proceed to the next step.

### Step 3: Preview

The **Preview** section displays sample queries to test the app’s behavior.

1. Click **+Add Query** to input additional test queries.
2. Once validated, click **Continue** to move to the final step.

### Step: 4 Publish

Publish your app and define access permissions and enablement.

To deploy the Agentic App, complete the following steps:

**Specify Publishing Details**:

* **Published Version**: Select the appropriate version for deployment.
* **Publish To**: Define access permissions:
    * **Admins**: Restrict usage to Admin users.
    * **Selected User Groups/Users**: Grant access to specific users or groups.
    * **Everyone in the Account**: Make the app available to all users.
* **Enablement Type**: Configure how users interact with the app:
    * **Always Enabled**: The app remains active and cannot be disabled.
    * **Users Choice**: Users can enable or disable the app as needed.

2. Click **three dots icon** next to the app’s name. A menu with the following options will appear:
    * **Edit**: Open and modify the app's details.
    * **Publish/Unpublish**: Change the app's status.
    * **Delete**: Permanently remove the app.
3. Select the required option and continue to complete the modifications as needed.

## Agent Options

Manage your app's deployment, data, and availability post-publication. Agent options are enabled after publishing your Agentic Application. You can perform the following actions on published apps:

* **Export Agent**: Download agent configuration and associated data.
* **Delete Agent**: Permanently remove the application.
* **Unpublish Agent**: Revert agent to draft status, making it unavailable for production use.
  
  **Caution**: Exercise caution when using delete or unpublish options, these actions directly impact your application's functionality.

## Example Implementation: Finance Advisor

### Flow Execution and Results

#### Step 1: Market Analysis Overview

The initial step employs the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) agent to conduct a comprehensive analysis of NVIDIA's market performance. The agent processes indexed files to evaluate current market indicators and historical performance patterns.

#### Step 2: Company Share Owners

During the second step, the system uses the API agent to retrieve detailed ownership information from the client database. This procedure produces a comprehensive overview of existing shareholders, which includes institutional investors, individual stakeholders, and client portfolio allocations.

#### Step 3: Client Information and Risk Factor

The third step activates the Prompt agent to perform a thorough risk evaluation and develop strategic recommendations. Based on the consolidated data from previous steps, the agent formulates hold or sell recommendations.

#### Step 4: Compose an Email

The final step automatically generates a professional email that synthesizes all analyses and recommendations from the previous flows.

**Email Format**:

* Professional business format with clear sections.
* Data visualizations and tables where applicable.
* Formal closing with contact details.
