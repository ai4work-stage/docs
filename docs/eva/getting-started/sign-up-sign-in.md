## Ask a Question

You can ask **AI for Work** an open question or a question from a specific agent. 

For example, Assume that you are connected to Jira. You ask the question, “Get my Jira issues” in the **Ask or search anything** search box. The Jira agent will be triggered and fetch your Jira issues. 

You can ask an open-ended question to **AI for Work**.
