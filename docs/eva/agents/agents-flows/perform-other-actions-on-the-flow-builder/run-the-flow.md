# Run Agent Flows

You can run a flow and test it to see how it works. Once you run the flow, a debug log opens and a context object is generated. Every node in the flow has a context temporary storage where you can view the context object at each node level.

The output shows the start, end, and elapsed time taken to run the flow, and if there are any unresolved issues.

**Steps to run the flow**:

1. On the top right corner of the navigation bar, click the **Run flow** icon.

1. On the top of the Run dialog, click the **Debug** icon to open the **Debug** log as shown in the following image.

    The debug log is opened and output results are started.
    
    You can view the following details in the debug log:


    * The values that you provided in the flow.


    * The flow level log details.


    * The node level details for each flow initiation.


    * The info link for each nodeâ€™s success or failure.


    * The metrics at each node such as Initiated on, Executed on, Total time taken, and Tokens (available only for AI node).


    * If the flow is successful, the copy icon is available to copy the output, and the overall run-time flow is displayed.


    * If there are any errors in the flow, an error message is displayed and the output key in the JSON format displayed will be empty, as shown in the image.
